## Project Overview

The Self-Care Manual is a web application designed to promote self-care and well-being. It provides users with a series of questions and prompts to help them reflect on their emotional and physical state, make positive choices and prioritise self-care. The application provides personalised answers and suggestions based on the user's input. Through a comforting interface featuring a dynamic image of a positivity frog, users navigate through a series of thoughtful questions guided by visual cues.

### Features

- **Interactive Questionnaire**: Engage with thought-provoking questions that encourage self-reflection and self-care.
- **Personalised Responses**: Receive answers and suggestions tailored to your choices, promoting a personalised self-care journey.
- **Randomised Suggestions**: Discover new self-care tips through randomised suggestions, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Navigate through a seamless user-friendly interface designed for a comforting self-care experience.
- **Dynamic Visual Cues**: Enjoy the visual cues provided by a dynamic image of a positivity frog that changes based on your responses to encourage a positive self-care journey.

## Learning and Progress

This project was an exciting journey in web development, encompassing front-end design, JavaScript programming, and interaction with JSON data. Here's what I learned and achieved during the development process:

- **Front-End Development**: I gained hands-on experience in building a user-friendly and responsive web interface using HTML and CSS. By designing a layout that maintains a consistent distance from the top and adjusting elements such as line spacing for better readability, I ensured an aesthetically pleasing and functional design.

- **JavaScript Programming**: I honed my JavaScript skills by implementing dynamic features such as button interactions, displaying randomised suggestions and managing the flow of questions and answers. I also tackled challenges such as ensuring a smooth transition between questions and resetting the dynamic image to its default state for each question.

- **Data Handling**: I successfully fetched and integrated data from a JSON file to create a dynamic questionnaire with customised responses, leveraging asynchronous programming to ensure a smooth user experience.

- **User Experience**: I focused on improving the user experience by ensuring that the application flows smoothly, presenting questions clearly, and providing helpful self-care suggestions. I also worked on improving the visual appeal by adding an image that changes based on user input, adding a touch of interactivity and visual feedback to the self-care journey.

- **Problem-Solving**: Along the way, I encountered and resolved several challenges, from handling user input to managing the flow of questions and answers. By tackling issues such as adjusting the spacing around the dynamic image and adding line breaks to improve the readability of the text, I improved the overall user experience.

I'm excited to share this project as a demonstration of my web development skills and my commitment to promoting self-care and well-being. Feel free to explore the Self-Care Guide and take some time for yourself today!
